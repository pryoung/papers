This folder contains routines used to generate figures for the article by M. Janvier et al. about the 2-April-2022 flare and CME that was observed by Solar Orbiter. The figures are derived from Hinode/EIS and SDO/AIA, and the article was submitted to the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics in April 2023.

There are five figures (jpeg format), each with their associated IDL routine (.pro). There is also a routine to generate the image frames for a movie.

Some AIA cutout FITS files are stored in the data sub-directory.

You will need to download the EIS FITS file with ID 20220402_130542, and calibrate it to level-1. For the movie routine, you should download the AIA cutout files available on Zenodo at:
