### Title: Properties of EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) Slot Observations

### Authors: Peter R. Young & Ignacio Ugarte Urra

### Journal: Solar Physics (in preparation)

To run the routines described below you will need to use the Solarsoft distribution, with the EIS and CHIANTI trees installed. Level-1 EIS FITS files are needed for some of the routines. These are generated from the publicly available level-0 files by running eis_prep in Solarsoft.
