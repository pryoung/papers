### Figures

The figures for the paper were generated with the following IDL routines.

#### Figure 1 (plot_aia_6_panel.png)

The AIA images are provided in the GitHub repository.

```
IDL> w=plot_aia_6_panel()
```

#### Figure 2 (plot_spray_6_panel)

You will need to download the EIS file and calibrate it with eis_prep. 

```
IDL> w=plot_spray_6_panel()
```

#### Figure 3 (plot_fe12_1g_redshift.png)

```
IDL> w=plot_fe12_1g_redshift()
```

#### Figure 4 (filaments.png)

This was created with Powerpoint and exported to a png.
